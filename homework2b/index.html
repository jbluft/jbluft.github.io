I'll never forget the first time I heard a Rush song. It was ninth grade. My buddy Mike and I left school after lunch and decided to take the rest of the afternoon off. We walked over to his house to play records instead.
<BR><BR>
Up to that point my taste in music could best be described as "suburban white kid." Which is to say I loved hip-hop, rap and anything the Beastie Boys put out. Not exactly eclectic. Anyway, Mike decided to edify this untrained ear by popping in the Hold Your Fire record from Rush.

<BR><BR>"Force Ten" was the first song I heard and I was hooked right away. It was the weirdest song I had ever heard. The music was so complex, with what I later came to know as time signatures changing all the time. It was a classic rock band but synthesizers were layered over all the bass, guitar and drums. "Orchestral" is the best way to describe it. The lyrics, written by the wizard drummer Neil Peart, were fascinating.

<BR><BR>
We spent the rest of the day playing Rush albums before I had to leave to catch my bus home. The trick there was to sneak around from the houses in front of the school and make it onto the bus before any of my teachers could see me. Many of them would come out with the kids and help them locate their correct buses and keep the peace. I made it onto my bus and then out of the corner of my eye saw my 7th period teacher lurking. I ducked. He hadn't seen me after all. Phew!
